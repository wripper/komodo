Zcash 1.0.8
===========

What is Zcash?
--------------

[Zcash](https://z.cash/) is an implementation of the "Zerocash" protocol.
Based on Bitcoin's code, it intends to offer a far higher standard of privacy
through a sophisticated zero-knowledge proving scheme that preserves
confidentiality of transaction metadata. Technical details are available
in our [Protocol Specification](https://github.com/zcash/zips/raw/master/protocol/protocol.pdf).

This software is the Zcash client. It downloads and stores the entire history
of Zcash transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network
connection, the synchronization process could take a day or more once the
blockchain has reached a significant size.

Komodo Specific Notes
=====================
 
Dependencies
------------
 
```
#The following packages are needed:
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libcurl4-gnutls-dev libc6-dev libevent-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool  libncurses5-dev unzip git python zlib1g-dev wget bsdmainutils automake libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libqt4-dev libqrencode-dev libdb++-dev ntp ntpdate
```
 
Komodo
------
 
```
git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo
cd komodo
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh

# -j8 uses 8 threads - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use
./zcutil/build.sh -j8
#This can take some time.
```
 
# to update an existing version, git checkout dPoW if not on that branch already

git pull

./zcutil/fetch-params.sh

./zcutil/build.sh -j8

To reset the blockchain, from ~/.komodo rm -rf blocks chainstate debug.log komodostate db.log

Create komodo.conf
------------------
 
```
cd ~
mkdir .komodo
cd .komodo
pico komodo.conf
#Add the following lines to the komodo.conf file:

rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
rpcpassword=password
txindex=1
addnode=5.9.102.210
addnode=78.47.196.146
addnode=178.63.69.164
addnode=88.198.65.74
addnode=5.9.122.241
addnode=144.76.94.38
addnode=89.248.166.91
```
 
Start mining
------------
 
```
#iguana documentation shows how to get the btcpubkey and wifstrs that need to be used

#bitcoin also need to be installed with txindex=1 and with rpc enabled

cd ~
cd komodo


#This will return your pubkey eg. "0259e137e5594cf8287195d13aed816af75bd5c04ae673296b51f66e7e8346e8d8" for your address
./src/komodo-cli validateaddress <yourwalletaddres>

#This will give the privkey of your wallet address
./src/komodo-cli dumpprivkey <yourwalletaddres>

#This will import the privkey to be sure the mined coins are placed into your wallet address
./src/komodo-cli importprivkey <yourwalletprivkey>

#To stop the daemon:
./src/komodo-cli stop

#This starts komodo notary - replace genproclimit with number of threads you want to use and add your pubkey
./src/komodod -gen -genproclimit=2 -notary -pubkey="0259e137e5594cf8287195d13aed816af75bd5c04ae673296b51f66e7e8346e8d8" &

#This will get the stats:
./src/komodo-cli getinfo

#To view the process:
ps -ef | grep komodod

#To stop the daemon:
./src/komodo-cli stop 
 
#To view komodod output:
tail -f ~/.komodo/debug.log

#To view all command
./src/komodo-cli help

ASSETCHAINS: -ac_name=name -ac_supply=nnnnn

Both komodod and komodo-cli recognize -ac_name=option so you can create a zcash fork from the commandline

Building
--------

Build Zcash along with most dependencies from source by running
./zcutil/build.sh. Currently only Linux is officially supported.

NOTE TO EXCHANGES:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1605144.msg17732151#msg17732151
There is a small chance that an outbound transaction will give an error due to mismatched values in wallet calculations. There is a -exchange option that you can run komodod with, but make sure to have the entire transaction history under the same -exchange mode. Otherwise you will get wallet conflicts.

To change modes:
a) backup all privkeys (launch komodod with -exportdir=<path> and dumpwallet)
b) start a totally new sync including wallet.dat, launch with same exportdir
c) stop it before it gets too far and import all the privkeys from a) using komodo-cli importwallet filename
d) resume sync till it gets to chaintip

For example:
./komodod -exportdir=/tmp &
./komodo-cli dumpwallet example
./komodo-cli stop
mv ~/.komodo ~/.komodo.old && mkdir ~/.komodo && cp ~/.komodo.old/komodo.conf ~/.komodo.old/peers.dat ~/.komodo
./komodod -exchange -exportdir=/tmp &
./komodo-cli importwallet /tmp/example
